## Repository Structure
- **Gromacs/**: Contains PDB files from molecular dynamics simulations after 200 ns of relaxation, a .sh script (e.g., for P720Q) with commands to run Gromacs, and the configuration files used for the analysis.
- **Phylogeny/**: Includes files related to phylogenetic analysis, such as tree files (`.treefile`) and visualizations.
- **ProLif_Interactions_analysis/**:
  - **.pkl/**: Stores `.pkl` data frames files representing interaction data for the proteins.
  - **.png/**: Contains heatmap images showing interaction for regions of interests.
  - **ProLif.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing protein-ligand interactions using ProLIF.
- **Protein-protein_docking/**: Files related to docking analysis, including interaction lists and a PyMOL script.
- **XVG_MD_Trajectory_Visualization/**: Jupyter Notebook for visualizing molecular dynamics trajectories.
